- Red star: ground truth
- black crosses: next batch queries recommended by SOBER
- white dots: historical observations
- Branin function: blackbox function to maximise
- $\pi$: the probability of global optima locations estimated by SOBER

## Brief explanation
![plot](./docs/visual_explanation.png)<br>

We solve batch global optimization as Bayesian quadrature;
$$x^*_\text{true} = $$
\text{argmax}_x f_\text{true}(x)
\delta_{x^*_\text{true}} \in \arg \max_{\pi} \int f_\text{true}(x) \text{d}\pi(x)
\quad \xLeftrightarrow{\text{dual}} \quad 

We query 10 points in parallel to the true blackbox function. Colours represent the GP surrogate model trying to approximate the three true posteriors (Ackley, Oscillatory, Branin-Hoo, see Supplementary Figure 4 for details).
The black dots in the animated GIF is the proposed points by BASQ for each iteration. At the third iteration, BASQ can capture the whole posterior surface.
