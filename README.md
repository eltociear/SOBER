## Brief explanation
![plot](./docs/visual_explanation.png)<br>

We query 100 points in parallel to the true posterior distribution. Colours represent the GP surrogate model trying to approximate the three true posteriors (Ackley, Oscillatory, Branin-Hoo, see Supplementary Figure 4 for details).
The black dots in the animated GIF is the proposed points by BASQ for each iteration. At the third iteration, BASQ can capture the whole posterior surface.
